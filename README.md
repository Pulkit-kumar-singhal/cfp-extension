### üïπÔ∏è Working

- To find out the total number of emissions done by data uploaded and data downloaded we first retrieved the number of packets through the **chromeapi** and stored them in the local chrome storage. 
- We Parse the JSON Object to get the details of amount of bytes exchanged in specific domains.
- These resources are then passed through a formula to Find out number of emissions and then these are stored in a database through a **classification** method stored in arrays.

- Finally , we Bring out the light to our Extension page through Making a UI for showing Total Emissions and Emission details on the main screen.
- Along with this, **Dashboard** Screen for all Ranking Webistes based off emissions and a detailed information on the amount of resources utilised while browsing.
